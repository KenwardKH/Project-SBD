I visited the Vietnam Memorial in DC and when I mentioned to the ranger who led me around that my Dad had fought in Vietnam his reply was ‚Äúoh your father is American?‚Äù.

I‚Äôve been to the same museum and appreciated seeing their story. Most research I‚Äôve read has always come from the Allied perspective and no display I‚Äôve seen in Australia or America has done a good job of detailing any atrocities Allied troops may have committed. We never will know the full story and photos and memories only tell us so much. For example, Nick Ut‚Äôs photo you‚Äôve featured (the naked girl running down the road) is thought to capture those atrocities. If he had taken that photo a few minutes later when the girl is drinking water given to her by someone in uniform and not screaming or crying any more (there‚Äôs video footage showing this), that image would have had a very different impact.

You are right, the involvement of countries other than America is very overlooked and so many places in the World are just not educated about this. Yes, in school we learn only about what caused the war, the book facts like how long it lasted, when it was, etc. There isn‚Äôt a depth to the education on it unless you look to outside sources for the education. I suppose this is true for a lot of school programs. I just feel that if people are going to travel and then visit things of historical significance that they should at least do some research so they aren‚Äôt standing there making bad comments around people that know better. You are right regarding the one-sided propaganda. We surely expected it, just was taken aback about the ‚ÄòAmerican Killer awards‚Äô. I agree with you though, perspective will always vary depending on how war affects you and your family. Nick Ut‚Äôs photo is beautiful and I guess depending on how much knowledge you have on the war, you will read it differently. It all depends on the context it is used in, but you are right, the moments following that frame were ones of peace, not conflict.

Unfortunately, many see Kuta, and Legian, and Seminyak, and think, ‚Äú‚ÄùBali‚Äù. Kuta may as well be Patong in Phuket, or any other over-touristy beach.\nI do hear you though; we‚Äôve heard the same thing from folks, and can see why. However, after spending 6 months in Bali, in places like Sanur, Lodtunduh, Kerouatan(both outside Ubud) and Jimbaran, I have to say Bali is the most pristine, quiet and peaceful place I‚Äôve visited outside of here in Savusavu, Fiji, and Koh Lanta, Thailand.\nThe airport and surrounding traffic is zooish, leading into Seminyak. As for the locals, the persistent ones are just part of Bali. But if you really open up, and speak to more and more folks, you‚Äôl find some of the kindest, warm-hearted people on earth.\nNext time, stay somewhere in the ricefields, outside of Ubud, and connect with some locals. After the temple ceremonies one Warung owner around the corner brought us plates and plates of sweets, fruits and otherwise amazing food, all without us asking for a thing. Big hearts, so kind, so helpful‚Ä¶.and this is after she rented out a motorbike to us for $55 for the month lol! Peaceful, quiet, serene, pristine, with crazy amounts of wildlife, and many of the locals are not jaded by tourists, nor pushy as they are in tourist spots. Totally different island all together.\nJimbaran is also peaceful and serene. Beach quiet earlier in the day, loads up a bit before evening. If you head to Amed and the north end you should be good to go too. \nJust stay away from Kuta, Seminyak and that area, if you want to see the real Bali. Someone gave me the same exact advice after my first month there, and on my 3 subsequent returns I did the rice field bit, as well as Jimbaran, and wow was it an amazing experience.\nNow if you want paradise, and pristine beaches, and genuinely, authentic, friendly folks, come here to Savusavu. No place like it on earth.\nOverall though I do hear ya, in that I can imagine if you have images of palms and white sands, and then you are rushed by transport drivers outside of the airport üòâ\nThanks for the share Lina, signing off from Fiji üòâ\nRyan', 131, NULL),

When I came back to my hometown 3 years ago, it was weird for me, an Egyptian, to be immersed into this lifestyle. I had nothing but my immediate family in Riyadh but suddenly cousins and distant relatives were kissing my cheeks and family was such an important thing in my life. I also got to differentiate between the foreigners I lived with in Saudi and this place where I‚Äôm only interacting with Egyptians and barely ever any outsiders. This allowed me to take an outside look on the stares given to any who looks slightly different. It gave me an insight on the closed views some Egyptians have. But honestly, you can‚Äôt really blame them, the middle east is a fairly closed off world. A foreigner wouldn‚Äôt understand our world and an Egyptian wouldn‚Äôt understand a foreigners world. However, with the internet and the western influence and the revolution, Egypt has changed. The people have changed. And with all my heart I can say Cairo is safe. I‚Äôm just a 16 year old yet I‚Äôm left to move around in taxis all over the place and yes, I‚Äôve been subjected to many different situations that weren‚Äôt too nice, it isn‚Äôt anything out of the ordinary.

And we‚Äôve gone to plenty of destinations not considered safe to travel independently (Colombia, Dominican Republic, Brazil, South Africa).\nOn the other hand, we‚Äôve also written off the Middle East/North Africa for the time being precisely because terrorists have been targeting foreign tourists, which is not the case with any of the examples above. We actually had planned to visit Turkey a few months ago and decided against it. And I‚Äôm glad ‚Äì although the chances are low that we would have been among the tourists killed in those explosions in Istanbul, I would never forgive myself for willingly putting ourselves in danger in a place where you know you might be intentionally targeted. \nReally that‚Äôs the deciding factor for me ie. am I putting myself or my wife in risk by going to a place where I know I may be intentionally targeted?

I understand your position, but really, we‚Äôve been in places that are far more dangerous to the every day traveler than Egypt. 2 days before our overland truck left Cape Town, South Africa our tour leader was robbed at gun point in the ‚Äòsafe‚Äô district. He was targeted for being western and presumably rich- as told by his assailant. Which is funny as you chose South Africa as the safer option to Turkey! We never felt unsafe in Egypt like we have in a few other destinations around the globe. As stated above, there are so few tourists in Egypt right now, it would hardly be worth there time to target a temple with say 10 people visiting it. I do understand the need to manage your own risk and the decisions that come with that. But honestly, for us, we have a greater chance of being in a plane crash than being in a terrorist situation, even with our travels in the Middle East. Visiting Egypt is not like visiting say, Syria or Afghanistan. Not all countries in the Middle East are created equal at the moment.

You‚Äôll see a lot of varying primate species, snakes including Anaconda, birds, Giant Otters, etc. At Napo, you have dense jungle and a blackwater system to observe. In comparison, the Tambopata region in Peru offers the Tambopata Research Center (here is our write-up on it: https://www.divergenttravelers.com/peru-tambopata-research-center/)in the thick primary rainforest. It is one of the best places in the world to see tropical birds, including macaws and parrots. There is also the possibility of jaguar sightings, primates, snakes, etc. But there is no black water system here. They do have Giant Otters at Oxbow Lake. While both in the Amazon, they are completely different experiences. I always ask people, what is your goal in visiting the Amazon? Are you going for photography? If so, what do you want to see? Then choose the destination based on that. Hope this helps! Feel free to reach out via email too if you need additonal help.', 402, 1232),

They are gas guzzlers (at almost 5$ a gallon, thats a consideration) and many of the folks renting them do not have experience driving them.

The first prisoner escaped in May 1933, went abroad and published a pamphlet about the horrors experienced (although they were not yet at mechanized genocide level), yet the world continued to trade and negotiate with Germany until September 1939 (and some countries beyond that).\nAs you have been to Dachau, you have also seen how close it is to the town of Dachau. This is also quite important, because after 1945, Germans liked to say ‚Äúoh, we didn‚Äôt know anything of the concentration camps‚Äù because the large death camps like Auschwitz or Sobibor were far in occupied Poland.

The flight arrived in the afternoon, and due to excitement I managed to stay awake till the evening, go to bed at a reasonable time and wake up at around 8.30am. The same happened the way back ‚Äì though I went to bed at 6pm when I arrived back in the UK, I woke up at 9am the next morning and slipped effortlessly back into my normal time zone!\nRambles aside, it really does depend on the person. And my theory is that since it was a complete opposite time zone and due to sleepless planes, it may even be easier (for me at least!) to adjust to NZ time‚Ä¶ But hopefully I‚Äôm just a jetlag-natural üòÄ', 690, NULL),

I think it has to do with the proximity to the international dateline. We arrived at around 11am and had no problem staying up all day and then going to bed at a normal time. We never had one ounce of Jet lag from that leg of travel. It was amazing!
